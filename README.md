## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m an Android developer building applications with a focus on modern architecture, clean code, and responsive user experiences. This repository highlights my work using Jetpack libraries to create scalable, maintainable, and testable Android apps that follow best practices.

Jetpack provides a powerful set of tools for modern Android development, and Iâ€™m actively working with libraries like ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation, Room, and DataStore. By integrating these components, Iâ€™m learning how to separate concerns, manage app state effectively, and persist data reliably across configuration changes.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects that explore MVVM architecture, dependency injection with Hilt, coroutines for asynchronous programming, and Jetpack Compose for building declarative UIs. I focus on structuring code in a modular, testable way, while also ensuring a smooth user experience through clean navigation flows, proper lifecycle management, and responsive UI updates.

Each project is designed to reinforce a concept or solve a specific challengeâ€”from building offline-first apps to implementing reactive data flows and unit testing core components. I also experiment with integrating third-party APIs, handling permissions, and managing complex UI states.

My goal is to continue growing as a developer by learning the latest tools and patterns while contributing clean, well-documented code. Iâ€™m especially interested in how architectural decisions impact app performance, user experience, and long-term maintainability.

If youâ€™re also working with Android, Jetpack libraries, or just interested in modern mobile development, feel free to explore the code, share feedback, or start a conversation. Iâ€™m always looking to improve and collaborate with others in the Android community.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building better Android apps, one module at a time.
